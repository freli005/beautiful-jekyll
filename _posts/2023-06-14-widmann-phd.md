title: David Widmann's PhD defense
---

My warmest congratulations to [Dr David Widmann](https://www.widmann.dev/) for a well defended PhD thesis, [Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Statistical Learning](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Auu%3Adiva-500736)! 

Thanks to the opponent, Dino Sejdinovic (University of Adelaide) for the very interesting discussion during the defense, and to the grading committee Meelis Kull (University of Tartu), Henrik Boström (Royal Institute of Technology), and Silvelyn Zwanzig (Uppsala University) for the careful review of the thesis! Thanks also to the reserve Tatjana Pavlenko (Uppsala University) for being ready to step in, and to Niklas Wahlström (Uppsala University) for chairing the defense.

Good luck with the next step in your career David!
