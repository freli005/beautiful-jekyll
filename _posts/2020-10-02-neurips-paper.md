Paper accepted for [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), together with Christian A Naesseth and David M Blei! We develop a method for optimizing the "inclusive" Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p||q) in the context of variational inference by blending VI and MCMC. Check out the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10374).
