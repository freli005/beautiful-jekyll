I started a new position as Associate Professor at the [Division of Statistics and Machine Learning (STIMA)](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ida/stima) on April 1, 2019. I set this site up as a personal academic web page, since it gives me a bit more control than my [offical page](https://liu.se/en/employee/freli29) at Link√∂ping University. The intention is to update it with more info about my research and teaching activities shortly.
