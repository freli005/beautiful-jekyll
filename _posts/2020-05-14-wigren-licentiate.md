title: Anna Wigren's licentiate presentation
---

Today my PhD student [Anna Wigren](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/annwi999) will defend her licentiate's thesis (= roughly half way to PhD), _Exploiting conjugacy in state-space models with sequential Monte Carlo_.

The external reviewer is [Umberto Picchini](https://umbertopicchini.github.io/), Chalmers University of Technology.

The presentation is live streamed through [Zoom](https://uu-se.zoom.us/j/64218087705). See [this page](http://www.it.uu.se/lesit/seminarium/) for additional details.

Good luck Anna!
