title: KAW project to Johanna Rosén!
---

Congratulations to [Johanna Rosén](https://liu.se/medarbetare/johro07) who has been granted 29 MSEK from the KAW foundation for _The 2D-Materials Frontier_. Together with co-applicant [Fredrik Heintz](https://liu.se/medarbetare/frehe08) I'm responsible for the machine learning part of the project, where we will use machine learning to aid the search for new and exciting 2D materials.
