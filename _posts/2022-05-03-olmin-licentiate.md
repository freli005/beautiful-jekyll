title: Amanda Olmins' licentiate thesis
---

On Friday 6 May my PhD student [Amanda Olmin](https://liu.se/medarbetare/amaol67) will defend her licentiate thesis (= roughly half way to PhD), entitled [_On Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Networks: Ensemble Distillation and Weak Supervision_](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1648236&dswid=-6704). The questioning will be lead by [Hossein Azizpour](https://www.kth.se/profile/azizpour), KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I'm looking forward to an interesting discussion - Good luck Amanda!
