title: David Widmann's licentiate thesis
---

On Oct 28 my PhD student [David Widmann](https://widmann.dev/) successfully defended his licentiate's thesis (= roughly half way to PhD), entitled _Calibration of Probabilistic Predictive Models_. The discussion was lead by [Meelis Kull](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yJwctG4AAAAJ&hl=en), University of Tartu.
