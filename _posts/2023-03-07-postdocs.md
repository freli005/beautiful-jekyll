title: Open postdoc positions

I'm looking for two postdocs to join us at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University.

1. Focus on geometric deep learning for developing new machine learning models and methods to aid in the quest for new ultra-thin materials. Working in a tight collaboration with world leading materials scientists in Linköping and Uppsala, you will get the chance to apply the developed ML methods in practice to search for new materials.

2. Focus on probabilistic machine learning for sequential generative models (e.g., auto-regressive and diffusion-based). The research aim is to develop novel models and associated inference and learning methods, combining state-of-the-art generative machine learning and approximate inference.

Deadline for both positions is March 19
