Time for another (dry) update...

In December last year my PhD student Anna Wigren successfully defended her thesis [_Sequential Monte Carlo methods for conjugate state-space models_](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1703961&dswid=9281). Congratulations Anna! Thanks to the opponent Simon Maskell and the grading committee Harri Lähdesmäki, Víctor Elvira and Tatjana Pavlenko for your excellent review of the thesis.

We got a few papers accepted for publication at
ICONIP ([_Active Learning with Weak Labels for Gaussian_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08335) with Amanda Olmin, Jakob Lindqvist, and Lennart Svensson),
ICASSP (_Enhancing Representation Learning with Deep Classifiers in Presence of Shortcut_, with Amir Ahmadian),
ICLR ([_DINO as a von Mises-Fisher mixture model_], with Hari Govindarajan, Per Sidén and Jacob Roll - **ICLR Notable Paper Top 25 %**), and
AISTATS ([_Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Irregular Data_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08415) with Joel Oskarsson and Per Sidén).
