title: Open postdoc positions
subtitle: Linköping University is recruiting several Postdocs in Machine Learning 
---

The Division of Statistics and Machine Learning ([STIMA](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ida/stima)) at Linköping University is recruiting several Postdocs in Machine Learning, to work on a range of research topics as described below. Linköping University is one of the [leading AI institutions](https://liu.se/en/news-item/liu-i-topp-inom-ai) in Sweden and is well recognized by solid contributions to [top machine learning](https://liu.se/en/news-item/de-ar-topp-36-i-varlden-inom-maskininlarning) conferences. The division has strong links to prominent national research initiatives, such as [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) and [ELLIIT](https://elliit.se/).

The goal of this recruitment is to expand our research activities related to several topics in machine learning, both applied and more fundamental. Common to all research topics is that you will work in an academic environment characterized by a tight integration of statistics and machine learning. We have a wide network of strong international collaborators all around the world, for example at the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Columbia University, UC Berkeley, University of Amsterdam, and University of British Columbia, giving rise to excellent opportunities for international collaboration. Furthermore, you will have access to state-of-the-art computing infrastructure for machine learning (e.g. through [BerzeLiUs](https://liu.se/en/news-item/sveriges-snabbaste-superdator-for-ai-ar-invigd)). The contact person at the division (PI/co-PI) for all projects listed below is associate professor [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/).

The suggested research topics for the open positions are:

### 1.	Machine learning for materials discovery ###
<img align="right" src="/img/material.png" width="100px"/>

You will be part of the KAW-funded cross-disciplinary project [The 2D Materials Frontier](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/research/seeking-formula-ultrathin-materials). In collaboration with physicists in Linköping and Uppsala, we will develop novel machine learning methods to aid in the quest for new ultra-thin materials, with applications in energy storage, catalysis, and water treatment, to mention a few. Relevant machine learning competMaences include graph neural networks, geometric deep learning, and active learning. 

### 2.	Novel AI methods for experimentally constrained protein structure prediction ###
This position is part of a joint collaboration between the two largest research programs in Sweden, the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) and the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS), with the ultimate goal of solving ground-breaking research questions across disciplines.

In collaboration with Prof Sebastian Westenhoff at Uppsala University, we will develop novel algorithms to include instance-specific experimental constraints in machine learning models, effectively bridging the gap between AI predictions and experimental observation. The algorithms will be widely applicable in many areas of AI. However, in particular we will focus on combining machine-learning-based protein structure predictions with experimental constraints obtained by single-particle cryo EM, to improve structure prediction and characterization of conformational heterogeneity of proteins. 

### 3.	AI-powered carbon border adjustments ###
The project is part of the Vinnova initiative AI in the service of climate. In a collaboration between climate policy experts, machine learning researchers and Swedish industry, we will develop a machine learning system for automatically generating and validating life cycle assessments. The goal of the project is to enable trustworthy carbon border adjustments, with the potential of significantly reducing CO2 emissions. Relevant machine learning skills include Bayesian inference, probabilistic graphical models, text analysis and natural language processing.

### 4.	Uncertainty quantification for machine learning ###
In this more basic research project, we will develop novel theory and methods for quantifying and handling various types of uncertainty in machine learning. This includes, for instance, interpretable calibration evaluation for generic probabilistic models, epistemic uncertainty quantification for neural networks, robust methods for out-out-distribution detection, and probabilistic modeling of input dependencies. 


### 5.	Spatio-temporal data analysis and hybrid modeling ###
Processes that evolve over both time and space are ubiquitous in science. Examples include the spread of a disease in a region, or the flow of traffic and evolution of various variables pertaining to the risk of traffic accidents. We will work on developing a new class of hybrid models for spatio-temporal data analysis and prediction, where complex simulators are integrated with machine learning at an unprecedented level.

This is a joint opening for all topics listed above. Please specify in your application letter which project(s) that you would be interested in working on - it is possible to apply for multiple topics with a single application. Alternatively, if you have other research ideas that you would like to pursue as a postdoc at STIMA, feel free to list them in your application instead/as well – we are open to own initiatives! 

### Teachers’ exemption (Lärarundantaget) ###
Researchers and academic staff at Swedish universities retain the rights to their own research results, even when these are patentable. This system is known as the “teachers’ exemption” (Lärarundantaget) and differs from the system at universities in other countries.
LiU provides support for researchers as inventors, with a unit at the university that helps researchers to patent ideas, and may even fund the patent application, while the patent is still owned by the researcher.
